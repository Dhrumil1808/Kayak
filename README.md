Built a responsive travel search engine to look across the web and book best flights, hotels and rental cars and enhanced
the scalability and reliability of application by using Kafka as middle ware for message queues.

Visualized an admin panel to analyse revenue logistics and generate web traffic graphical report by city
and year and tracked user activity like clicks per page, time spent per page and more visited pages and implemented SQL database
caching using Redis to optimize expensive trip to database for faster search results.
